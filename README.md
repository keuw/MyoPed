# MyoPed

### UofTHacks IV Project

Myo Band app for paediatric rehabilitation. Specifically focusing on children with functional disability in the arms, requiring regular exercise of the muscles.

We created a 2D side scroller where the objective is to pass obstacles using motion controls via the Myo. These motion controls range from small motions such as tapping your fingers or clenching your fist to large movements such as swinging your arm. Our game consists of multiple stages / difficulty levels depending on the stage of rehabilitation and the type of muscle movements the patient is capable of performing.

We have also setup an external server which can receive live data from the application, such as reaction time, and time taken for specific actions. This will allow for tracking and analyzing the patients conditions as well as progress towards rehabilitation.

For the future, more levels will be implemented, the tracking could be further optimized, and proper analysis could be done on the data that we can record.
